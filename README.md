# BA-kit

BA-kit is a business analysis toolkit for agentic coding environments. It packages a single end-to-end BA skill, focused agent roles, workflow rules, and reusable templates so discovery, requirements, and handoff work follow a consistent solo-IT-BA-friendly operating model in Claude Code and Codex.

## What It Includes

- 1 unified BA workflow skill (`ba-start`) plus 1 maintenance skill (`ba-kit-update`)
- 4 agent roles for structured delegation
- 2 workflow and quality rule files
- reusable document and wireframe workflow templates, including a requirements backbone
- Project instructions and configuration for BA engagements

## How A BA Uses BA-kit

BA-kit is meant to be used as a BA workstation, not just a template repo.

A solo BA typically uses it like this:

1. Start with raw input: BRD draft, RFP, meeting notes, process notes, screenshots, or pasted requirements.
2. Run `/ba-start` or `/ba-start intake ...` to normalize the input and surface gaps.
3. Lock scope and build the `backbone` as the single source of truth for the engagement.
4. Emit only the artifacts the engagement actually needs:
   - `lite`: intake + backbone + stories
   - `hybrid` default: backbone + stories + selective FRD/SRS + critical wireframes
   - `formal`: full FRD + SRS + wireframes + packaged handoff
5. Use rerun commands like `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, and `package` only when that slice needs to be refreshed.
6. Use `status` to see what exists, what is missing, and whether any delegated slice is stalled.

The intended working style is:

- write once in the backbone, then derive downstream artifacts
- avoid producing full SRS and full wireframes unless the project really needs them
- keep outputs traceable enough for product, dev, QA, vendor, or stakeholder handoff

### Typical BA Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Mode | Typical Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery / backlog shaping | `lite` | intake, backbone, user stories |
| Solo IT BA on product or internal system | `hybrid` | backbone, stories, targeted FRD/SRS, critical wireframes |
| Vendor handoff / regulated change / formal approval | `formal` | full FRD, full SRS, wireframes, packaged HTML |

### Core Commands For A BA

```text
/ba-start
/ba-start intake docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf
/ba-start backbone --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start stories --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start srs --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start wireframes --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start package --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start status --slug warehouse-rfp
```

### What You Get Back

- normalized intake
- scoped work plan
- requirements backbone
- FRD and user stories when needed
- selective or full SRS depending on mode
- Pencil wireframes for critical or approved screens
- packaged HTML deliverables for stakeholder review

## Dependencies

Use this as the practical dependency checklist.

| Dependency | Needed For | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code CLI | Running BA-kit as an installed Claude workflow | Core for Claude runtime |
| Codex with repo-level `AGENTS.md` support | Running BA-kit directly inside Codex | Core for Codex runtime |
| Bash-compatible shell | Running `install.sh`, `ba-kit update`, and helper scripts | Yes |
| Python 3 | HTML packaging via `scripts/md-to-html.py` | Required for packaging |
| Node.js | Running `scripts/install-codex-ba-kit.sh` and Codex agent registration | Required only for Codex converted install |
| Pencil / Pencil MCP runtime | Generating `.pen` wireframes and PNG exports in the `wireframes` step | Required only for wireframes |

Notes:

- If you do not need wireframes, BA-kit can still run intake, backbone, stories, FRD, and non-wireframe SRS work without Pencil.
- If your BA workflow includes UI-backed screens and you want BA-kit to generate wireframes, your agent runtime must expose Pencil tooling. In practice this means a Pencil MCP or equivalent Pencil-backed runtime, not just the `designs/` folder.
- If you skip packaging, Python 3 is not required for the analysis steps themselves.

## Prerequisites

- A supported runtime:
  - Claude Code CLI with access to `~/.claude/`
  - or Codex with repo-level `AGENTS.md` support
- Bash-compatible shell for running installers and helper commands
- Python 3 if you want HTML packaging
- Node.js if you want to run `scripts/install-codex-ba-kit.sh`
- Pencil / Pencil MCP if you want generated wireframes

## Installation

### Claude Code Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository locally.
2. Run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

3. Restart Claude Code if it is already running.

The installer also installs a shared update command:

```bash
ba-kit update
ba-kit status --slug warehouse-rfp
```

It checks the registered BA-kit source repo for dirty state or unfinished merge/rebase work, runs `git pull --ff-only`, then reinstalls Claude and Codex assets that were previously installed from that repo.

The installer copies:
- the BA skill directory under `skills/` to `~/.claude/skills/`
- `agents/` to `~/.claude/agents/`
- `rules/` to `~/.claude/rules/ba-kit/`
- `templates/` to `~/.claude/templates/`

## Use With Codex

BA-kit supports Codex through the root [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) file and repo-local playbooks:
- Codex should read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for persistent repository instructions
- `skills/` acts as BA reference playbooks
- `rules/` and `templates/` provide workflow and artifact structure
- `designs/` stores Pencil `.pen` files for SRS screen wireframes

Codex does not require `./install.sh` or installation into `~/.claude`. Open the repository with `AGENTS.md` present, then explicitly direct Codex to use the relevant BA playbook from `skills/`. The root `AGENTS.md` now carries the minimum non-negotiable BA defaults, but `skills/ba-start/SKILL.md` is still the required workflow source for non-trivial BA tasks.

If you are using the Codex-converted bundle, install it into the local Codex runtime with:

```bash
bash scripts/install-codex-ba-kit.sh
```

That script copies the converted assets from `codex/skills/**` and `codex/agents/**` into `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.codex/agents`, then appends any missing agent registrations into `~/.codex/config.toml` without duplicating existing entries.

The Codex installer also refreshes the shared `ba-kit` update command and records the source repo so future updates can be done with:

```bash
ba-kit update
```

See [docs/codex-setup.md](./docs/codex-setup.md) for prompt patterns and setup guidance.

Core defaults across Claude Code and Codex:
- BA deliverables are written in Vietnamese by default unless the user explicitly requests English.
- The dated artifact-set token uses `YYMMDD-HHmm` consistently across `plans/reports/*` and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`.
- The default engagement mode is `hybrid`: build the backbone first, then emit only the downstream artifacts the engagement actually needs.
- When UI scope exists, wireframes default to Shadcn UI unless the user explicitly overrides it.

`plans/` is a local BA workspace, not shipped example content. Keep generated `plans/reports/*` artifacts and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` local to your engagement and out of version control.

## Workflow And Commands

Full workflow:

```text
/ba-start
```

Resumable subcommands:

```text
/ba-start intake docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf
/ba-start backbone --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start frd --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start stories --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start srs --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start wireframes --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start package --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start status --slug warehouse-rfp
```

Default `/ba-start` still runs the full lifecycle:
1. Parsing raw input into a structured intake form
2. Gap analysis and clarifying questions
3. Scope lock and mode selection
4. Requirements backbone production
5. Gated FRD and user story generation
6. Selective SRS production
7. Wireframe generation from use cases and screen contract when justified
8. Final screen description production
9. Unified browser-editable HTML packaging for the emitted artifacts

For rerun commands, resolution order is:
1. Explicit `--slug <slug>`
2. A single detected project in `plans/reports/`
3. Otherwise stop and ask the user to choose

If one slug has multiple dated artifact sets, `/ba-start` should stop and ask which dated set to use instead of silently taking the latest one.

## Skill

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ba-start` | Single BA entry point with full workflow plus `intake`, `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, and `status` subcommands |
| `ba-kit-update` | Maintenance entry point that runs `ba-kit update` to pull and reinstall BA-kit |

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements-engineer` | Requirements elicitation, structuring, validation |
| `ui-ux-designer` | Pencil wireframe generation from SRS screens |
| `ba-documentation-manager` | Deliverable quality, consistency, and packaging |
| `ba-researcher` | Domain, market, and solution research |

## Template Library

Templates live in `./templates/` and cover:
- Requirements backbone
- SRS (software requirements specification)
- FRD (functional requirements document)
- User stories
- Intake form
- Wireframe input packs for resumable Step 9 generation
- Wireframe maps for persisted SRS linkback

Wireframe artifacts for SRS screen sections live under `./designs/` as Pencil `.pen` files. See [designs/README.md](./designs/README.md) for the naming convention.

For UI-backed work, BA-kit now defaults to the Shadcn UI design system for wireframes and UI-oriented handoff unless you explicitly request another system.

BA-kit packages intake, FRD, user stories, and SRS into one shared HTML shell with consistent metadata, visual chrome, and in-browser editing controls. The SRS HTML remains the primary stakeholder handoff, while the other HTML artifacts provide aligned review copies for the same engagement.

`/ba-start status` reports regular artifacts as exists or missing with last-modified dates, including the persisted backbone. Wireframes use explicit states: `completed`, `skipped`, `not-applicable`, or `missing`. Non-trivial delegated slices should also surface from trackers under `plans/{date}-{slug}/delegation/`, including likely stalled runs when heartbeats go stale.

## Configuration

BA-kit uses [`.ck.json`](./.ck.json) to define project paths, plan naming, methodology defaults, and quality assertions. The default methodology is `hybrid`.

## Example Scenarios

### New Product Discovery

Use `/ba-start` with a raw requirements document to produce an intake form, a requirements backbone, user stories with AC, selective FRD/SRS slices, and wireframes only where they help review or handoff. Use `/ba-start status --slug <slug>` to inspect progress after an interrupted session.

### ERP Process Improvement

Use `/ba-start` with process descriptions as input. The skill produces FRD with workflows, user stories for the delivery team, and SRS with technical specs.

### Regulated Workflow Change

Use `/ba-start` with regulatory context. The SRS captures compliance constraints, the FRD covers business rules, and user stories include acceptance criteria tied to regulations.

## Contributing

Keep additions aligned with BA-kit principles:
- practical over theoretical
- reusable templates over ad hoc prose
- traceability over ambiguity
- Mermaid for diagrams

When changing the skill, also update templates or rules if the workflow contract changes. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution expectations and validation steps.
