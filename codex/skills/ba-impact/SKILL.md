## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$ba-impact`.
- Treat all user text after `$ba-impact` as `{{BA_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{BA_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
BA workflows may use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

- `header` -> `header`
- `question` -> `question`
- option text -> `{label, description}`

If `request_user_input` is unavailable, ask a concise plain-text question instead.

<objective>
Run BA change-impact triage for an existing project set.

This command must not mutate artifacts. It should analyze the change first, then return the next commands.
