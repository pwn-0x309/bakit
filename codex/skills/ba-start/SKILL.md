name: ba-start
description: Lifecycle engine for BA-kit. Accepts raw requirements (file or text), normalizes them, locks scope, builds a requirements backbone, emits only the necessary BA artifacts, and packages deliverables.

# BA Start

Use this skill to run an end-to-end business analysis engagement from raw input to packaged deliverables. Treat `ba-do` as the freeform router and use `ba-start` once the lifecycle step is explicit. `ba-start` supports step-level subcommands for resumable and partial runs.

## Invocation

```text
/ba-start
/ba-start intake <file>
/ba-start intake
/ba-start impact --slug <slug>
/ba-start impact --slug <slug> <change-file>
/ba-start backbone --slug <slug>
/ba-start frd --slug <slug>
/ba-start stories --slug <slug>
/ba-start srs --slug <slug>
/ba-start wireframes --slug <slug>
/ba-start package --slug <slug>
/ba-start status --slug <slug>
```

## Priority Contract

Read this section first. Only continue to the detailed step sections when you need the exact production instructions for the selected command.

### Fast execution order

1. Parse `ARGUMENTS` before doing any work.
2. Resolve the subcommand: `intake`, `impact`, `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, or `status`.
3. Apply output defaults:
   - write BA deliverables in Vietnamese unless the user explicitly requests English
   - use `YYMMDD-HHmm` as the artifact-set `{date}` token
   - default the engagement mode to `hybrid` unless the user explicitly selects `lite` or `formal`
   - default the project `DESIGN.md` baseline to Shadcn UI unless the user explicitly overrides it
4. Resolve the target scope with exact matching only:
   - explicit `--slug <slug>` first
   - otherwise use a single detected slug only
   - if multiple slugs exist, stop and ask
   - if multiple dated sets exist for the slug, stop and ask
5. Check prerequisites for the chosen command.
6. If any prerequisite is missing, print the missing exact path, print the exact prior subcommand to run, and stop.
7. Before mutating `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, or `package`, if the target output already exists, ask whether to overwrite or stop.

### Command routing summary

| Command | Runs | Must read first | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| no subcommand | Full workflow | raw input | intake, backbone, gated downstream artifacts by mode |
| `intake` | Steps 1-4 | raw input | intake + plan |
| `impact` | change-impact triage only | exact project set + change input | impact summary + recommended path + exact next commands |
| `backbone` | Step 5 | intake | requirements backbone |
| `frd` | Step 6 | backbone | FRD + FRD HTML |
| `stories` | Step 7 | backbone | user stories |
| `srs` | Steps 8-11 | backbone + user stories | grouped SRS + wireframe-input + project runtime DESIGN.md + merged SRS + gated wireframes |
| `wireframes` | Step 9 only | wireframe-input or exact wireframe source set | `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md`, `.pen`, exports, wireframe-map, wireframe-state |
| `package` | Step 12 only | emitted artifact set + non-missing wireframe-state when SRS screens exist | FRD/SRS HTML + delivery summary |
| `status` | inspection only | none | checklist output |

### Non-negotiable stop conditions

- Never silently choose a slug or dated set by mtime.
- Never use broad `*-{slug}*` matching when exact artifact patterns are available.
- The backbone is the primary authoring source after intake. Do not re-derive downstream artifacts from raw intake when the backbone exists.
- `wireframes` is read-only on upstream BA artifacts. It may regenerate only runtime design outputs, `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md`, `wireframe-map`, and the wireframe-state marker.
- `package` must block only when wireframe state is `missing`.
- If no wireframe-state marker exists, treat it as `not-applicable` only when the SRS set has no UI-backed screens or Screen Contract Lite section. Otherwise treat it as `missing`.

## Shared Routing And State Rules

### Core operating defaults

- Write BA deliverables in Vietnamese by default unless the user explicitly requests English.
- Treat the artifact-set `{date}` token as `YYMMDD-HHmm` consistently across report filenames and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`.
- Default the engagement mode to `hybrid` for solo IT BA work. Use `lite` only when speed matters more than formal artifacts, and `formal` only when governance or handoff needs justify the full set.
- For UI-backed scope, use Shadcn UI as the default component baseline only when the approved project `DESIGN.md` does not override it.

### Argument parsing

Parse `ARGUMENTS` before doing any work.

1. Read tokens left to right.
2. Extract `--slug <slug>` and `--mode <lite|hybrid|formal>` if present.
3. The first remaining token that matches one of these values is the subcommand:
   - `intake`
   - `impact`
   - `backbone`
   - `frd`
   - `stories`
   - `srs`
   - `wireframes`
   - `package`
   - `status`
4. If there is no subcommand:
   - run the full workflow
   - if one free argument remains, treat it as the initial file path or pasted-input hint for Step 1
5. For `intake`, one free argument may be a direct file path.
6. For `impact`, one free argument may be a direct file path for the change request. If no free argument is present, accept pasted change text in the conversation.
7. For `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, and `status`, reject unexpected free arguments, print the supported syntax, and stop.
8. If the first token looks like an unknown subcommand, print the supported subcommand list and stop.

### Routing rules

- No subcommand means full workflow. Keep the existing lifecycle order intact.
- `intake` runs Steps 1-4 only.
- `impact` runs the change-impact triage path only. It does not mutate artifacts.
- `backbone` runs Step 5 only.
- `frd` runs Step 6 only.
- `stories` runs Step 7 only.
- `srs` runs Steps 8-11 and applies mode gates instead of assuming full-screen/full-spec coverage.
- `wireframes` runs Step 9 only as a re-run path from the persisted wireframe input pack or exact fallback sources.
- `package` runs Step 12 only.
- `status` inspects current artifacts and prints a checklist with dates.

### Natural-language routing

When the user does not explicitly name a subcommand, infer `impact` when all of these are true:

- the user references an existing project set, a downstream step or artifact such as `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, or `package`, or says they want to add the change into the current `intake` or `backbone`
- the user says a requirement, rule, actor, acceptance criterion, screen behavior, or scope item has changed, been added, or been removed
- the request is not obviously limited to wording, typo, formatting, or layout-only cleanup

Also infer `impact` when both of these are true:

- exactly one existing project set can be resolved from the current workspace context
- the user sends a bare requirement or correction statement such as a single sentence, bullet, or short note, without explicitly asking to edit, overwrite, regenerate, or rerun an artifact

Example user intents that should route to `impact`:

- "Đang viết dở SRS thì thêm yêu cầu này"
- "Rule này đổi từ 1 cấp duyệt sang 2 cấp"
- "Màn hình này phải thêm trạng thái khóa"
- "Bổ sung audit log cho export CSV"
- "Không có nhóm admin user"
- "Không cho xóa dữ liệu khi đã chốt kỳ"

Do not route to `impact` for obvious no-impact edits such as typo fixes, wording cleanup, or formatting-only changes.

Do not mutate artifacts directly from a bare requirement or correction statement. Treat that input as change evidence for `impact` first. Only mutate when the user explicitly asks to update, edit, overwrite, regenerate, rerun, or otherwise apply the change to a named artifact or step.

### Slug resolution

Subcommands that operate on an existing project must resolve the target project slug in this order:

1. Use the explicit `--slug <slug>` value when provided.
2. Otherwise inspect `plans/reports/final/` and `plans/reports/drafts/` for exact BA-kit artifact patterns and collect unique candidate slugs.
3. If exactly one candidate slug exists, use it.
4. If multiple candidate slugs exist, print the candidate list, ask the user to choose a slug or rerun with `--slug`, and stop.

For mutating subcommands (`backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`) and for `impact`, never silently choose a slug by mtime.

### Dated set resolution

After resolving the slug, resolve the target dated artifact set.

1. Inspect exact filenames for the selected slug:
   - `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`
   - `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
   - `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`
2. Build candidate `{date}` sets from exact filename matches only.
3. If exactly one dated set exists for the slug, use it.
4. If multiple dated sets exist for that slug and the command is `impact`, `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, or `status`, print the available dates, ask the user to choose the target dated set, and stop until the user chooses.
5. Never silently select the latest dated set by mtime.

### Exact artifact matching

Use exact filename patterns, not broad `*-{slug}*` matching. Print the specific missing artifact path when a prerequisite check fails.

### Legacy artifact detection

Before mutating `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, or `status`:

1. Check whether `plans/reports/`, `plans/reports/final/`, or `plans/reports/drafts/` contains legacy BA-kit report names such as:
   - `plans/reports/002-intake-form.md`
   - `plans/reports/002-gap-analysis.md`
   - `plans/reports/002-*.md`
2. If legacy reports are present but the current exact-pattern artifacts for the selected slug/date are missing, stop and report:
   - that a legacy artifact suite was detected
   - that the current playbook will not infer slug/date or prerequisite state from legacy filenames
   - the exact next action: rerun `intake`, migrate the old reports manually, or point the agent at the current-contract artifacts
3. Do not mix legacy-named reports with the current exact-pattern lifecycle in one silent pass.

### Prerequisite reference

| Command | Requires | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intake` | Raw input (file or pasted text) | `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`, `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` |
| `impact` | resolved slug/date, change input, `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md` | impact summary + exact next commands only |
| `backbone` | `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md` | `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md` |
| `frd` | `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md` | `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`, `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.html` |
| `stories` | `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md` | `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md` |
| `srs` | `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`, `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md` | `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`, `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`, and any supporting `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-*.md` files |
| `wireframes` | `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md` or exact fallback sources for pack generation | `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md`, `designs/{slug}/*.pen`, `designs/{slug}/exports/**`, `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md`, `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` |
| `package` | emitted downstream artifacts for the selected mode; wireframes may be completed, skipped, or not-applicable | packaged HTML artifacts, delivery summary |
| `status` | None | Checklist output only |

### Missing prerequisite behavior

If a required artifact is missing:

1. Print the missing exact path.
2. Print the exact subcommand to run first.
3. Stop. Do not chain forward automatically.

### Overwrite handling

Before mutating `backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, or `package`:

1. Check whether the target artifact already exists.
2. If it exists, print the path and ask whether to overwrite or stop.
3. If the user declines or does not approve, stop without mutating anything.

### Context-loss recovery

If exploration consumed too much context or the host truncates part of the conversation:

1. Reconstruct the current target from the already-resolved subcommand, slug, dated set, and on-disk prerequisite artifacts.
2. Continue from the next unresolved step when those values are still unambiguous.
3. Do not ask the user to restate the original request just because intermediate exploration consumed context.
4. Ask the user again only when one of these is genuinely unknown:
   - the target subcommand
   - the slug
   - the dated set
   - overwrite approval for an existing target artifact
5. When recovering, print a short status line with:
   - current command
   - resolved slug
   - resolved date
   - next exact step
6. Do not restart broad artifact discovery after the target scope has already been accepted.

### Accepted-scope execution lock

For mutating rerun commands (`backbone`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`):

1. Once the user has explicitly approved the next step, treat the target command as locked for the current run.
2. After that approval, do not fall back to generic prompts such as:
   - "What would you like me to help with?"
   - "What would you like me to do with this document?"
   - "Please restate what you need"
3. Continue from the resolved command, slug, dated set, and exact prerequisites on disk unless one of those values is genuinely unknown.
4. If context pressure occurs after the lock is established, print a short recovery line and resume the exact step instead of reopening discovery.
5. Reading one prerequisite artifact does not reset the execution lock.

### Delegated run tracking

When a non-trivial BA slice is delegated to a sub-agent, persist a dedicated run-status tracker under:

`plans/{date}-{slug}/delegation/{owner}-{slice}.md`

Rules:

1. The orchestrator creates the tracker before spawning the worker.
2. Use one tracker file per delegated slice so two workers never edit the same tracker.
3. The tracker must record:
   - owner
   - slice name
   - target artifact
   - current status: `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `needs-repartition`, `blocked`, `failed`, or `stalled`
   - started time
   - last heartbeat time
   - stall threshold in minutes
   - expected outputs
   - latest milestone or blocker
4. The delegated packet must include the exact tracker path.
5. The worker updates the tracker:
   - immediately on start by changing status to `running`
   - after each major milestone
   - at least every 5 minutes during long-running work
   - on exit with `completed`, `needs-repartition`, `blocked`, or `failed`
6. If no heartbeat arrives within 10 minutes and the target artifact has not advanced, treat the slice as `stalled` instead of waiting blindly.
7. On a suspected stall, stop broad waiting behavior and do one of:
   - inspect the tracker and current target artifact
   - rerun the same slice with a narrower packet
   - ask the user whether to retry or stop if the next action is ambiguous
8. The `status` subcommand should surface active delegation trackers for the selected slug/date and flag likely stalls.

### Wireframe state model

Persist an explicit wireframe-state marker after every Step 9 run at:

`plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`

Use this structure:

```md
# Wireframe State

- Slug: {slug}
- Date: {date}
- State: completed | skipped | not-applicable | missing
- Source: plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md OR exact fallback source set
- Input Pack: plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md
- Mapping: plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md
- Artifacts:
  - designs/{slug}/{artifact-name}.pen
- Exports:
  - designs/{slug}/exports/{artifact-name}/SCR-xx-name.png
- Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
- Notes: short rationale
```

State meanings:

- `completed`: `.pen` artifacts and expected exports were generated.
- `skipped`: the user explicitly chose to skip wireframes in Step 9.
- `not-applicable`: the selected scope has no UI-backed screens or no Screen Contract Lite requirement.
- `missing`: wireframes are required for the selected SRS set but the artifacts are absent or the run failed before completion.

`package` must block only when the state is `missing`.

`status` must print the explicit wireframe state and the marker last-modified date. If no marker exists:

- treat the state as `not-applicable` only when the selected SRS set has no UI-backed screens or Screen Contract Lite section
- otherwise treat it as `missing`

## Full Workflow

When no subcommand is provided, run the complete lifecycle in order:

1. `intake`
2. `backbone`
3. emit downstream artifacts according to mode:
   - `lite`: `stories`
   - `hybrid`: `frd` when justified, `stories`, selective `srs`, gated `wireframes`
   - `formal`: `frd`, `stories`, full `srs`, full approved `wireframes`
4. `package`

Preserve exact slug/date resolution, but do not force the full artifact suite when the selected mode does not justify it.

## Subcommand: intake

Run Steps 1-4 only.

### Prerequisites

- Requires raw input as a file path or pasted text.
- If no input argument is provided, prompt the user for either a file path or pasted text.
- `--slug <slug>` may override the derived project slug.

### Step 1 - Accept input

Ask the user to provide one of:

- A file path (PDF, MD, TXT, image, DOCX)
- Pasted text containing requirements or business context

File reading approach:

- PDF: use native PDF-capable reading tooling
- Markdown or text: read directly
- Images: use multimodal reading
- Word (`.docx`): use multimodal extraction or ask the user to export to PDF or Markdown first

### Step 2 - Parse and normalize

Read the source material and extract content into the [intake-form-template.md](../../templates/intake-form-template.md) structure:

- Project name, date, requester
- Business context (problem, goals, stakeholders mentioned)
- Raw requirements (extracted verbatim)
- Screens or UI mentioned
- Processes or workflows mentioned
- Constraints, assumptions, compliance needs
- Open questions identified during parsing

Save the completed intake form to `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`.

### Step 3 - Gap analysis

Review the normalized intake against a BA completeness checklist:

- Are stakeholders identified with roles and influence?
- Is there a clear problem statement and measurable goal?
- Are scope boundaries defined (in-scope vs out-of-scope)?
- Are success criteria or KPIs stated?
- Are compliance or regulatory obligations mentioned?
- Are UI screens described enough to wireframe?
- Are processes described enough to map?

Flag each gap explicitly.

### Step 4 - Ask clarifying questions and lock scope

Present the identified gaps to the user as 3-8 targeted questions. Focus on:

- Output language
- Missing stakeholders or decision makers
- Ambiguous scope boundaries
- Unstated success criteria
- Regulatory or compliance context
- Priority and sequencing preferences
- Engagement mode preference only when the user already knows it; otherwise default to `hybrid`

Incorporate the answers back into the intake form.

Do not package intake to HTML by default. Intake remains a markdown source artifact unless the user explicitly asks for an ad hoc conversion.

### Step 4.1 - Generate work plan

Based on the normalized intake, produce a scoped work plan covering the selected or default engagement mode:

#### Deliverable selection

| Condition | Deliverable | Template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Always after scope lock | Requirements backbone | `requirements-backbone-template.md` |
| Detailed functional spec needed | FRD | `frd-template.md` |
| Agile team needs stories | User stories | `user-story-template.md` |
| System spec with screens, use cases, or test cases | SRS | `srs-template.md` |
| UI screens mentioned | Wireframes | `designs/{slug}/` via Pencil MCP, grouped by flow or module with frame-level screen mapping |

Mode defaults:

- `lite`: intake + backbone + user stories by default; emit more only on explicit request
- `hybrid`: intake + backbone + user stories, plus targeted FRD/SRS slices when risk or handoff needs justify them
- `formal`: full artifact suite

SRS default routing in `hybrid` or `formal`: include SRS when the intake contains any of:

- UI screens or screen descriptions
- System-level interactions (APIs, integrations, data flows)
- Mobile or web application scope
- Test case or acceptance testing expectations

#### Agent delegation

| Agent | When |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements-engineer` | Backbone, FRD, user stories, and selective SRS content |
| `ui-ux-designer` | Pencil wireframe generation from SRS screens |
| `ba-documentation-manager` | Validation pack, final packaging, and quality review |
| `ba-researcher` | Domain research when external context is needed |

Execution order:

`Intake -> Backbone -> Mode-gated downstream artifacts -> Quality Review`

UI design system default: unless the user explicitly asks for another system, use Shadcn UI as the default component and layout baseline only until the approved project `DESIGN.md` overrides those choices.

Save the work plan to `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`.

## Subcommand: impact

Run the change-impact triage path only.

### Purpose

Use this subcommand when an existing project set already exists and the user introduces a new requirement, a changed rule, a removed scope item, or a screen behavior change while downstream authoring is already in progress.

This subcommand is also the default safe landing zone for a bare correction statement in an existing project context, for example:

- "Không có nhóm admin user"
- "Phải có 2 cấp duyệt"
- "Không cho sửa sau khi đã nộp"

The goal is to decide:

- whether the change is only a wording clarification or a real baseline change
- which artifact is the current source of truth for the change
- which downstream artifacts are invalidated
- the narrowest safe rerun path
- the exact commands the user should run next

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require a change input:
  - a direct file path as the free argument, or
  - pasted change text in the conversation
- Require `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`.
- If the intake artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user to run `/ba-start intake`, and stop.
- Read the backbone when it exists:
  - `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`
- Read downstream artifacts only when they exist and only when they are relevant to the suspected impact:
  - `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` when it exists and adds gate context
- Do not scan unrelated report files once slug/date is resolved.
- If only legacy-named report suites exist for the apparent project, stop with the legacy artifact detection message instead of inferring from them.

### Output

Print a structured impact triage summary. Do not mutate artifacts.

### Decision rules

Treat the current source of truth in this order:

1. `backbone` when it exists
2. otherwise `intake`

Classify the change into one or more of these buckets:

- `wording-only`: no requirement intent, acceptance criteria, behavior, scope, or traceability impact
- `clarification-only`: narrows or explains an existing requirement without changing business intent or scope
- `backbone-change`: changes feature map, FR/NFR inventory, actor responsibility, acceptance-criteria intent, or artifact gates
- `scope-lock-change`: changes business problem, desired outcome, out-of-scope boundary, success metric, or a scope decision already locked in intake/backbone
- `ui-impact`: changes screen inventory, navigation, state model, field behavior, validation surfaces, or wireframe assumptions

Evaluate impact against these exact anchors when present:

- intake: business problem, goals, out-of-scope, success metrics
- backbone: scope lock summary, feature map, FR/NFR backbone, actors, story map, UI/screen coverage, artifact gates
- FRD: feature wording, workflows, business rules, integration points
- user stories: story intent and acceptance criteria
- SRS: use cases, Screen Contract Lite, validation rules, screen inventory, final screen descriptions
- wireframe artifacts: screen-to-frame mapping, runtime `DESIGN.md` assumptions, wireframe state

### Impact routing rules

- If the change touches goals, out-of-scope, success metrics, or scope decisions, route to `intake` first.
- If the change touches feature scope, FR/NFR intent, actors, or acceptance-criteria intent, route to `backbone` first.
- If the change stays within existing backbone intent but changes story wording or testable acceptance detail, route to `stories`.
- If the change stays within existing backbone and story intent but changes use case flow, validation behavior, error states, or screen behavior, route to `srs`.
- If the change affects screen inventory, state variants, navigation, overlays, or field interactions that wireframes must show, mark `ui-impact` and include `wireframes` after the required upstream rerun.
- Never recommend `package` as the first remediation step after a real requirement change. `package` remains downstream of content correction.

### Consult rules

- `requirements-engineer` is the default owner of the impact analysis.
- Consult `ui-ux-designer` only when `ui-impact` is present.
- Consult `ba-researcher` only when the change depends on external domain rules or unresolved evidence.
- Consult `ba-documentation-manager` only for final consistency review after reruns, not for the initial triage decision.

### Stop conditions

- Stop and ask focused questions if the change text is too vague to classify.
- Stop and ask for slug/date selection if the shared resolution rules remain ambiguous.
- Stop and report the exact missing prerequisite path if intake is missing.
- Stop if only legacy artifacts exist for the apparent project.

### Output format

Print a summary like this:

```text
Project: {slug}
Date set: {date}
Current Step: {detected-current-step-or-unknown}

Impact Summary:
- Change Type: [wording-only | clarification-only | backbone-change | scope-lock-change | ui-impact]
- Source Of Truth To Update: [intake | backbone | stories | srs]
- Current Source Of Truth Used For Analysis: [backbone | intake]

Affected Artifacts:
- [artifact]

Unaffected Artifacts:
- [artifact]

Recommended Path:
1. [next step]
2. [next step]

Exact Commands:
- /ba-start [subcommand] --slug {slug}
- /ba-start [subcommand] --slug {slug}

Questions:
- [only when required]
```

## Subcommand: backbone

Run Step 5 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`.
- If the intake artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user to run `/ba-start intake`, and stop.
- Run a narrow backbone preflight before reading content:
  - read only `plans/reports/final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md` and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` when it exists
  - do not scan unrelated files in `plans/reports/final/` once the target slug/date is resolved

### Output

- `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`

### Step 5 - Build the requirements backbone

Create the persisted source-of-truth artifact using [requirements-backbone-template.md](../../templates/requirements-backbone-template.md).

The backbone must contain:

- scope lock summary
- selected engagement mode (`lite`, `hybrid`, or `formal`)
- business goals and success metrics
- actors and feature map
- FR/NFR draft inventory
- preliminary story map
- UI/screen coverage assessment
- artifact emission gates
- assumptions, risks, and open questions

Backbone rules:

- treat the backbone as the primary authoring source after intake
- do not draft FRD, stories, or SRS directly from raw intake once the backbone exists
- keep the artifact concise and decision-oriented; this is not a merged FRD/SRS

## Subcommand: frd

Run Step 6 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`.
- If the backbone artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user to run `/ba-start backbone --slug {slug}`, and stop.
- Trust the user intent. Do not re-check whether the work plan selected FRD.
- Run a narrow FRD preflight before reading content:
  - read only `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md` and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` when it exists
  - do not scan unrelated files in `plans/reports/final/` once the target slug/date is resolved
  - if only legacy-named report suites exist for the apparent project, stop with the legacy artifact detection message instead of inferring from them

### Output

- `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`
- `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.html`

### Step 6 - Produce FRD

FRD execution rules:

- Start from the exact backbone artifact only, plus the exact plan path when it exists.
- If the user already confirmed that FRD authoring should proceed, continue from the resolved backbone instead of reopening scope discovery.
- Do not ask what the user wants to do with the document after the FRD step has been accepted.
- In `hybrid` mode, keep the FRD concise and focus on features, workflows, business rules, and integration-relevant context.
- In `lite` mode, emit the FRD only when the user explicitly asks for it.

Produce the FRD from the backbone using [frd-template.md](../../templates/frd-template.md):

- Functional overview
- User personas
- Feature list with MoSCoW priorities
- Workflows (Mermaid)
- Data requirements
- Business rules
- Integration points
- Acceptance criteria

Save to `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`.

Export FRD to HTML for rendered Mermaid workflows:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md
```

Output: `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.html`

## Subcommand: stories

Run Step 7 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`.
- If the backbone artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user to run `/ba-start backbone --slug {slug}`, and stop.
- Run a narrow stories preflight before reading content:
  - read only `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - read `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` only when it exists and only if it adds needed scope context
  - read `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md` only when it already exists and adds needed vocabulary or workflow structure
  - do not scan unrelated files in `plans/reports/final/` once the target slug/date is resolved
  - if only legacy-named report suites exist for the apparent project, stop with the legacy artifact detection message instead of inferring from them

### Output

- `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`

### Step 7 - Produce user stories

Stories execution rules:

- Start from the exact backbone artifact only, plus the exact plan path when it is genuinely needed.
- Pull the FRD only when it already exists or the current mode requires it.
- If the user already confirmed that user-story generation should proceed, continue from the resolved backbone instead of reopening discovery.
- Do not ask what the user wants to do with the document after the stories step has been accepted.

Generate Agile user stories from the backbone feature map and FR draft using [user-story-template.md](../../templates/user-story-template.md):

- Epic and feature breakdown
- User stories with acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- INVEST validation
- Story-to-screen alignment when UI exists

User stories with their acceptance criteria become the primary input for SRS, wireframes, and downstream artifacts. Every SRS functional requirement, use case, and screen description should trace back to one or more user stories.

Save to `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`.

Do not package user stories to HTML by default. Keep them as markdown unless the user explicitly asks for an ad hoc conversion.

## Subcommand: srs

Run Steps 8-11 only. This path applies mode gates instead of assuming a full-detail SRS every time.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require:
  - `plans/reports/final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`
- If a required artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user which subcommand to run first, and stop.
- Run an SRS preflight before reading content:
  - read only the resolved backbone, user stories, optional FRD, and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` when it exists
  - do not scan unrelated files in `plans/reports/final/` and `plans/reports/drafts/` once the target slug/date is resolved
  - if only legacy-named report suites exist for the apparent project, stop with the legacy artifact detection message instead of inferring from them

### Output

- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-a.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-d.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-e.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-f.md`
- `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`
- Any wireframe artifacts and the wireframe-state marker produced during Step 9

### Step 8 - Produce SRS core, use cases, and Screen Contract Lite

SRS is the largest artifact. Produce only the slices justified by the selected mode and artifact gates, then keep wireframes ahead of final screen descriptions.

SRS preflight execution rules:

- Start from the exact prerequisite set only. Do not read every report in `plans/reports/final/` and `plans/reports/drafts/` to "understand the full picture".
- Trust the accepted scope. If the user has already confirmed that SRS authoring should proceed, continue from the resolved backbone and user stories instead of reopening discovery.
- Pull in extra analysis artifacts only when the exact SRS slice needs them and cite the exact path or section.
- If an extra artifact is useful but non-essential, note it as optional context instead of blocking the run.
- In `lite` mode, do not run SRS unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- In `hybrid` mode, default to selective SRS coverage: complex flows, risky validations, integrations, and screens that materially affect delivery or handoff.
- In `formal` mode, emit the full SRS set.

Provide the relevant upstream context to the SRS production owner:

- Matching intake summary
- Backbone features, gates, and risks
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- FRD features and business rules only when FRD exists or the current mode requires it

Sub-agent context management:

- Pass only relevant sections of upstream artifacts, not full documents.
- Group A receives: intake summary, backbone FR/NFR inventory, optional FRD sections, user stories.
- Group B receives: Group A FR table and user stories.
- Group C receives: Group B use cases and user stories.
- Group D receives: backbone technical gates, Group A FR table, and FRD technical sections only when the technical slice is required.
- Group E receives: Group B use cases, Group C screen contract, and wireframe mapping.
- Group F receives: FR IDs, UC IDs, SCR IDs, story IDs, and the final group outputs for documentation-manager validation and packaging.
- When a group would produce more than 15 use cases or 10 screens, split into sub-groups.

Sub-agent handoff packet:

- Every delegated packet must include only:
  - objective and target artifact path
  - exact write scope
  - delegation status tracker path
  - exact upstream excerpts needed for that slice
  - FR, UC, SCR, or story IDs needed for traceability
  - expected output sections
  - heartbeat cadence and stall threshold
- Do not pass full merged artifacts when a section excerpt is sufficient.
- Do not repeat the full playbook, full rules, and full templates inside every delegated call. The orchestrator should resolve the workflow first, then pass only the relevant constraints.
- If the handoff packet cannot fit into one concise brief with a few targeted excerpts, repartition before spawning.

Delegation fallback:

- If a delegated worker lacks required context, it must stop and return the exact missing sections or IDs instead of inferring.
- If a delegated worker receives a scope that is too large to keep consistent, it must return `NEEDS_REPARTITION` with:
  - the overloaded artifact or section
  - the reason the scope is too large
  - the smallest viable split proposal
  - the exact upstream sections needed for the rerun
- On `NEEDS_REPARTITION`, rerun only the affected group or subgroup. Do not restart the whole SRS pipeline.
- **Never delegate assembly or merge steps to a sub-agent.** Merging group fragments into a final artifact (SRS, FRD, HTML) must run inline in the orchestrator using incremental Read-then-Edit-append writes. Sub-agents have a 200k context window and limited output tokens; a merged SRS can easily exceed both.
- Similarly, never delegate HTML conversion of a large merged artifact to a sub-agent. Run md-to-html inline or chunk the conversion.

Delegation packet template:

```md
# Delegation Packet

```

Repartition response template:

```md
NEEDS_REPARTITION

- Overloaded Scope: [artifact/section]
- Reason: [why the current slice is too large or underspecified]
- Smallest Viable Split:
  - [slice 1]
  - [slice 2]
- Required Upstream Inputs For Rerun:
  - [exact path + section]
  - [exact IDs]
```

#### Group A - Core

Sections:

- Purpose and Scope
- Overall Description
- Functional Requirements table

Output: `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-a.md`

#### Group B - Behavioral

Sections:

- Use Case Specifications

Output: `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md`

Consistency rules:

- Each use case links to user stories and screens.
- Actor actions use the same terminology as the user stories and FRD.

#### Group C - Screen Contract Lite

Sections:

- Screen Contract Lite
- Screen Inventory

Output: `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`

Consistency rules:

- Each primary screen links to its use cases and user stories.
- Screen Contract Lite must define screen IDs, entry and exit conditions, key actions, and required states.
- Modal, dialog, drawer, and overlay screens with their own interaction logic are primary screens, not supporting states.

#### Step 8.1 - Build wireframe input pack

After Group B and Group C are complete, assemble a persisted wireframe input artifact before any design work starts.

Source inputs:

- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
- relevant FRD and user-story excerpts needed for traceability

Save to `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`.

The wireframe input pack must contain:

- artifact set information and app type
- target project runtime design document path
- exact use case excerpts needed for each primary screen
- Screen Contract Lite
- Screen Inventory
- approved runtime design decision snapshot or explicit gaps that still require user choice
- proposed artifact grouping plan
- stop conditions for missing context or overloaded screen sets

#### Step 8.2 - Capture design decisions and persist project runtime DESIGN.md

Before any AI agent generates wireframes, ask the user to make or approve the design decisions that will define the project-specific runtime `DESIGN.md`.

Decision intake must cover:

- reference direction: existing brand guidance, a custom brief, or a named external `DESIGN.md` inspiration
- visual tone and density
- color direction and contrast expectations
- typography direction
- component feel: borders, radius, formality, dashboard density, navigation style
- layout and responsive priority
- hard constraints and explicit anti-patterns

If `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md` already exists, ask whether to:

- reuse the approved file as-is
- refresh it from new decisions
- stop

If no file exists, or the user asks to refresh it:

- synthesize `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md` from the approved decisions using `templates/design-md-template.md`
- keep Shadcn UI as the default component baseline only when the approved `DESIGN.md` does not specify a different direction
- stop before Step 9 if design decisions remain unresolved

#### Group D - Technical

Sections:

- Non-functional requirements
- Data flow diagrams
- ERD
- API specifications
- Constraints

Output: `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-d.md`

Technical slice gate:

- Produce Group D only when integrations, NFR exposure, data modelling, API handoff, or vendor/governance needs justify it.

### Step 9 - Generate wireframes from use cases, Screen Contract Lite, and approved runtime DESIGN.md

Run the Step 9 workflow exactly as defined in the `wireframes` subcommand below, but treat it as part of the SRS pipeline and keep the same `{date}` set.

Mode defaults inside the SRS pipeline:

- `lite`: skip wireframes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- `hybrid`: generate critical-screen wireframes first
- `formal`: generate the full approved screen set

### Step 10 - Produce final screen descriptions

After Step 9 resolves, expand the full Screen Descriptions from:

- Use Case Specifications
- Screen Contract Lite
- `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md` when wireframe state is `completed`
- Supporting frame inventory

If wireframes are `skipped` or `not-applicable`, expand the screen descriptions from use cases and Screen Contract Lite only, and keep Pencil references explicitly absent.

If wireframe state is `completed` but `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md` is missing, stop and rerun `/ba-start wireframes --slug {slug}` before expanding final screen descriptions.

Output: `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-e.md`

Screen field table format:

| Field Name | Field Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Field] | [Type] | Display: [...] / Behaviour: [...] / Validation: [...] |

The description column contains up to three rule categories as needed:

- Display Rules: visibility, defaults, read-only conditions, formatting
- Behaviour Rules: on-change actions, auto-fill, cascading, navigation triggers
- Validation Rules: required, format, range, cross-field, error messages

### Step 10.1 - Produce validation pack

Produce the validation and traceability pack from the completed SRS sections. Prefer `ba-documentation-manager` ownership when this slice is delegated.

Sections:

- Test Cases
- Glossary
- Traceability cross-references

Output: `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-f.md`

### Step 11 - Assembly and quality review

After all groups complete, the **orchestrator** assembles the final SRS inline. Do not delegate assembly to a sub-agent — the merged output is likely to exceed sub-agent output token limits.

Assembly procedure (incremental writes):

1. Write the SRS skeleton to `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md` using the `srs-template.md` heading structure with empty section bodies.
2. For each group in template section order (A → B → C → D → E → F):
   a. Read the group fragment from `plans/reports/drafts/`.
   b. Edit-append the fragment content into the matching section of the skeleton.
   c. Confirm the edit succeeded before moving to the next group.
3. After all groups are appended, run a cross-artifact consistency check on the file on disk:
   - Every UC step maps to a screen field or action and vice versa.
   - Screen Contract Lite entries have matching wireframes and final screen descriptions.
   - UC actor actions use the same wording as screen User Actions.
   - UC system responses match screen Behaviour Rules.
   - UC alternate flows are reflected in screen Error or States.
   - Field names are identical between UC steps, screen field tables, and wireframe labels.
   - User story acceptance criteria are covered by UC postconditions and screen Validation Rules.
4. Resolve UC placeholder references in screens.
5. Resolve ID conflicts across namespaces.
6. Verify every SCR and UC traces back to user stories.
7. Apply inline fixes to the file on disk using Edit, not by regenerating the whole file.
8. Delete group fragments only after the merged SRS is verified.

Execution order:

```text
Group A
  -> Group B
  -> Group D
Group B -> Group C
Group C -> Wireframes
Wireframes -> Group E
Group E -> Group F
Group F -> Assembly
```

Failure handling: if a grouped pass fails, retry once. If it still fails, complete that group inline. Assembly (Step 11) always runs inline regardless of failure state — never delegate the merge to a sub-agent.

## Subcommand: wireframes

Run Step 9 only. This path must be read-only on upstream artifacts and regenerate only runtime design outputs, the project `DESIGN.md`, `wireframe-map`, and the explicit wireframe-state marker.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Resolve the wireframe source in this order:
  1. `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`
  2. exact pair `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md` + `plans/reports/drafts/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
  3. `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md` only when Use Case Specifications, Screen Contract Lite, and Screen Inventory are already assembled there
- If source 2 or 3 is used, build or refresh `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md` before generating wireframes.
- If none of the sources exist, print all expected paths, tell the user to run `/ba-start srs --slug {slug}`, and stop.

### Output

- `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md`
- `designs/{slug}/{artifact-name}.pen`
- `designs/{slug}/exports/{artifact-name}/SCR-xx-name.png`
- `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md`
- `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`

### Step 9.1 - Resolve wireframe input pack

Use `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md` as the primary wireframe generation source.

If the pack is missing but fallback sources exist:

- assemble the pack first from exact use case excerpts, Screen Contract Lite, and Screen Inventory
- save it before continuing

Parse the input pack to build the generation plan:

- group related screens into one or more Pencil artifacts by flow, module, or journey
- treat modal, dialog, and drawer overlays with flow impact as primary screens
- for each primary screen, derive required supporting frames from the documented states, validation rules, table or list behavior, and feedback surfaces
- carry forward the runtime design-document target path `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md`

### Step 9.2 - Ask for or refresh project runtime DESIGN.md

Before any wireframe generation starts:

- check whether `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md` already exists
- if it exists, ask whether to reuse it or refresh it from new decisions
- if it does not exist, ask the user to make the design decisions needed to create it

Minimum decision set:

- reference direction or inspiration source
- visual tone
- color direction
- typography direction
- component feel
- layout/responsive priority
- explicit anti-patterns

After the user answers:

- persist or refresh `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md`
- summarize the approved choices in `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md`
- treat the resulting `DESIGN.md` as a project runtime artifact and semi-finished handoff input for the wireframe agent, not as a final BA deliverable
- stop if the user declines to approve a design direction

### Step 9.3 - Ask for wireframe preference

If Step 9 runs as part of the full `/ba-start` or `/ba-start srs` pipeline and the user has not explicitly asked to skip or manually choose screens, default to:

- `lite`: skip unless a screen is explicitly marked critical
- `hybrid`: generate critical-screen wireframes automatically
- `formal`: generate all approved wireframes automatically

If Step 9 runs through the standalone `wireframes` subcommand without an explicit preference, ask:

```text
The screen contract defines {N} primary screens. How should I generate wireframes?
- Generate all approved wireframes automatically
- Let me pick which screens
- Skip wireframes
```

If the user skips:

- persist `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` with `State: skipped`
- stop without changing upstream artifacts

If the scope has no UI-backed screens:

- persist the marker with `State: not-applicable`
- stop

If wireframes are expected but generation fails before completion:

- persist the marker with `State: missing`
- stop and report the failure

### Step 9.4 - Generate Pencil wireframes and mapping

For each approved screen group:

1. Read the linked use case excerpts, Screen Contract Lite entries, and Screen Inventory rows from the wireframe input pack.
2. Read `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md` and treat it as the system design document for the current wireframe run.
3. Verify that the wireframe intent matches the same actions, flow steps, required states, and approved design decisions.
4. Use `web-app` or `mobile-app` guidelines as appropriate.
5. Use Shadcn UI as the default component baseline only when `DESIGN.md` does not override it.
6. Create or update one `.pen` artifact per approved screen group.
7. Create one frame per primary screen and one frame per required supporting state or view.
8. Validate screenshots against the Use Cases, Screen Contract Lite, and approved `DESIGN.md`.
9. Record screen-to-artifact-to-frame mapping, including supporting frames and export targets, for every generated artifact.
10. Save each artifact to `designs/{slug}/{artifact-name}.pen`.

### Step 9.5 - Export wireframes to PNG

Export each relevant primary frame to PNG for embedding in the final SRS HTML:

```text
designs/{slug}/exports/{artifact-name}/SCR-xx-name.png
```

After successful export:

- persist `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md` with the final artifact, frame, and export mapping
- persist `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` with `State: completed`
- list the input-pack, project `DESIGN.md`, mapping, artifact, and export paths in the marker

## Subcommand: package

Run Step 12 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require at least one emitted downstream artifact for the selected mode.
- If the engagement emitted an SRS, require `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`.
- If the merged SRS is required but missing, print the exact path, tell the user to run `/ba-start srs --slug {slug}`, and stop.
- Read `plans/reports/drafts/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` when present.
- If the wireframe state is `missing`, print the marker path, tell the user to run `/ba-start wireframes --slug {slug}`, and stop.
- If the wireframe state is `completed`, `skipped`, or `not-applicable`, continue.

### Output

- packaged HTML for the emitted artifact set
- Delivery summary

### Step 12 - Package deliverables

Run a final packaging and quality pass:

- Keep the default `package` scope narrow: validate the existing artifact set, then regenerate `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.html` when FRD exists and `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.html` when SRS exists.
- Do not treat `package` as a full rebuild of intake, backbone, user-stories, and SRS drafts. Only FRD and SRS are standard HTML outputs unless the user explicitly asks for an ad hoc conversion.
- Verify all deliverables follow their templates.
- Check cross-references between the backbone and every emitted downstream artifact.
- When FRD and SRS exist, check their cross-references against stories.
- Verify user-story traceability: every emitted SRS FR, UC, and SCR maps to at least one user story.
- Run a cross-artifact consistency audit:
  - UC actor actions match screen User Actions.
  - Screen Contract Lite entries match both the wireframes and the final screen descriptions.
  - When wireframes are completed, wireframe-map entries match the final Pencil artifact paths, frame names, and exported PNG references used by the SRS.
  - UC system responses match screen Behaviour Rules.
  - Field names are identical across UC steps, screen field tables, and wireframes.
  - User story acceptance criteria are covered by UC postconditions and screen Validation Rules.
  - FRD features are fully covered by user stories and SRS requirements.
- Validate naming conventions and file structure.
- Verify the target FRD and SRS HTML artifacts use the shared BA-kit HTML shell and document metadata header.
- Flag broken links or missing sections.
- Produce a delivery summary.

### Step 12.1 - Generate packaged HTML for the emitted engagement

When the engagement includes a merged SRS, convert it to HTML with wireframe images embedded inline:

Convert the merged SRS markdown to HTML with wireframe images embedded inline:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md
python scripts/md-to-html.py plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md
```

Output:

- `plans/reports/final/frd-{date}-{slug}.html` when FRD exists
- `plans/reports/final/srs-{date}-{slug}.html` when SRS exists

When the engagement does not include an SRS, package only the artifacts that were actually emitted and requested for stakeholder handoff.

The final HTML should present:

- Use Case Specifications
- Wireframe images for primary screens when present
- Final Screen Descriptions
- Remaining SRS sections needed for traceability and review

### Step 12.2 - Final output structure

```text
plans/
  reports/
    final/
      intake-{slug}-{date}.md
      backbone-{date}-{slug}.md
      frd-{date}-{slug}.md
      frd-{date}-{slug}.html
      user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}.html
    drafts/
      srs-{date}-{slug}-group-a.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}-group-d.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}-group-e.md
      srs-{date}-{slug}-group-f.md
      wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md
      wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md
      wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md
  {date}-{slug}/
    plan.md
    delegation/
      requirements-engineer-group-a.md

        SCR-01-login.png
        SCR-02-otp.png
      checkout/
        SCR-05-review-order.png
```

The HTML files are produced only for FRD and SRS. All other BA artifacts remain markdown sources. Draft SRS slices and wireframe runtime files stay under `plans/reports/drafts/`, separate from final deliverables.

## Subcommand: status

Inspect the selected project set and print a checklist with artifact name, exists or missing status, last-modified date, and any active delegated worker slices.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- If slug or dated set resolution is ambiguous, print the choices and stop until the user selects one.

### Output format

Print a checklist like this:

```text
Project: {slug}
Date set: {date}

- [x] final/intake-{slug}-{date}.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] final/backbone-{date}-{slug}.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] final/frd-{date}-{slug}.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] final/frd-{date}-{slug}.html — 2026-03-26
- [ ] final/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md — missing
- [ ] final/srs-{date}-{slug}.md — missing
- [ ] drafts/wireframe-input-{date}-{slug}.md — missing
- [ ] drafts/wireframe-map-{date}-{slug}.md — missing
- [ ] designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md — missing
- [!] wireframes — skipped — 2026-03-26

Delegated slices:

- [~] requirements-engineer-group-b — running — last heartbeat 2026-03-26 15:42
- [!] ui-ux-designer-auth-flow — likely stalled — last heartbeat 2026-03-26 15:31 (>10m threshold)
```

Status rules:

- For regular artifacts, print `exists` or `missing` with the last-modified date when present.
- For wireframes, print the explicit wireframe state (`completed`, `skipped`, `not-applicable`, or `missing`) plus the marker date.
- When wireframes are `completed`, also list the detected project runtime `DESIGN.md`, input pack, wireframe map, `.pen` artifact paths, and export folders under `designs/{slug}/`.
- For delegated slices under `plans/{date}-{slug}/delegation/`, print:
  - `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `needs-repartition`, `blocked`, or `failed` directly from the tracker
  - `likely stalled` when the tracker says `running` or `queued` but the last heartbeat is older than the tracker threshold
  - the last heartbeat timestamp and latest milestone or blocker when present

## Agent Delegation

| Agent | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements-engineer` | Backbone, FRD, user stories, selective SRS content |
| `ui-ux-designer` | Pencil wireframe generation |
| `ba-documentation-manager` | Validation pack, quality review, and packaging |
| `ba-researcher` | Domain research when needed |

## Quality Check

- Intake form has no blank required sections.
- Every gap is resolved or listed as an open question.
- Backbone exists before FRD, stories, or SRS are emitted.
- Backbone gates explain why each downstream artifact exists or is skipped.
- FRD covers the selected features with priorities and acceptance criteria when the FRD gate is open.
- User stories follow INVEST and have Given/When/Then acceptance criteria.
- SRS flow follows: Backbone -> User Stories -> selective Use Case Specification -> Screen Contract Lite -> gated Wireframes -> Final Screen Descriptions -> Validation Pack -> Unified HTML.
- SRS covers only the slices justified by the selected mode and artifact gates.
- Every FR, UC, and SCR links to at least one user story.
- Screen Contract Lite exists for every primary screen before wireframes are generated.
- An approved project `DESIGN.md` exists before AI wireframes are generated.
- Screen field tables use the Display/Behaviour/Validation description format.
- Cross-artifact consistency is enforced across UC steps, screen fields, actions, and wireframe labels.
- `hybrid` mode defaults to critical-screen wireframes first; `formal` mode covers the full approved set.
- Wireframes are generated from the use cases and Screen Contract Lite before final screen descriptions are expanded.
- Every UC actor action has a matching screen User Action.
- Every UC system response has a matching screen Behaviour Rule.
- Wireframes match their SRS screen descriptions field by field.
- Wireframes use the approved `DESIGN.md` as the system design document, with Shadcn UI only as the fallback component baseline.
- SRS screens link to `.pen` artifacts and frame references unless wireframes were explicitly skipped or not applicable.
- Screen IDs stay aligned between SRS and Pencil frame names.
- Modal, drawer, and dialog overlays with flow impact are modeled as primary screens.
- Supporting state frames implied by screen behavior exist in `.pen` and are listed in the SRS screen inventory.
- Cross-references between backbone, FRD, user stories, and SRS are consistent.

## Token Efficiency

- Pass minimal context to downstream workers.
- Reuse the intake summary instead of the raw source once normalization is complete.
- Read templates once and pass only the relevant sections to each artifact owner.
- Split large use case or screen sets into smaller groups when needed.
- For wireframes, pass only the assigned screen slices rather than the full SRS.
- Prefer slim handoff packets: objective, write scope, trace IDs, and a few quoted excerpts. If you are tempted to attach full upstream documents, repartition first.
- Do not combine content generation, full cross-artifact audit, and packaging into the same delegated call when the artifact set is already large.
- If one delegated slice still feels too large after summarization, stop and split it again rather than hoping the worker keeps the whole context consistent.

### Large artifact write protocol

Assembly and merge steps that produce artifacts longer than roughly 150 lines must use **incremental writes** instead of a single Write call.

1. **Write the skeleton first**: create the target file with the template structure (headings, boilerplate, front matter) using one Write call.
2. **Append group content sequentially**: for each group fragment, Read the fragment, then Edit-append it into the correct section of the target file. Complete one group before starting the next.
3. **Never generate the entire merged content in memory and flush it in one Write call.** The output token budget of a sub-agent (or even the orchestrator) may not be large enough to hold the full artifact.
4. **Assembly must run inline** (orchestrator context), not delegated to a sub-agent. Merged SRS, merged FRD, and HTML conversion are all assembly tasks.
5. After all groups are appended, run validation on the file already on disk rather than validating an in-memory draft.
