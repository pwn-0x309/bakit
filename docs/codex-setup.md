# Using BA-kit With Codex

## Purpose

BA-kit can work with Codex as a repo-native BA operating guide. The root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) gives Codex persistent instructions, while the `skills/`, `rules/`, and `templates/` folders provide detailed task guidance.

## What Codex Uses

- [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) as the persistent repo instruction file
- `skills/` as reference playbooks for BA task types
- `rules/` as BA quality and workflow constraints
- `templates/` as deliverable structures
- `designs/` for Pencil wireframe artifacts referenced by SRS screen sections

## Codex Conversion Install

If you have the Codex-converted bundle for `ba-start`, install it from the repository root with:

```bash
bash scripts/install-codex-ba-kit.sh
```

The installer expects the converted source tree under:

- `codex/skills/**`
- `codex/agents/**`

It copies those files into:

- `~/.codex/skills`
- `~/.codex/agents`

It also appends any missing Codex agent registrations into `~/.codex/config.toml` in an idempotent way, so rerunning the script is safe.

## Recommended Codex Workflow

1. Start with the business outcome or artifact you need.
2. Tell Codex to use the BA playbook.
3. Point it at the target template.
4. If UI is involved, point it at the relevant Pencil `.pen` artifacts and frame mappings in `designs/`.
5. Ask for assumptions, open questions, and a draft output.
6. If you installed the Codex conversion, ask Codex to use `ba-start` from `~/.codex/skills/ba-start/SKILL.md` and the registered BA agents from `~/.codex/agents`.
7. Unless you explicitly override it, BA-kit should use Shadcn UI as the default design system for wireframes and UI handoff.

## Prompt Patterns

### Full BA Engagement

```text
Use AGENTS.md and skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
Parse the requirements in docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf.
Produce an intake form, FRD, user stories, use case specifications, Screen Contract Lite, wireframes, final screen descriptions, and a browser-editable HTML SRS.
```

### Codex Conversion

```text
Use the installed ba-start skill from ~/.codex/skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
Use the registered Codex BA agents from ~/.codex/agents when the skill delegates work.
Parse the requirements in docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf.
Produce an intake form, FRD, user stories, use case specifications, Screen Contract Lite, wireframes, final screen descriptions, and a browser-editable HTML SRS.
```

### Formal Requirements Only

```text
Use AGENTS.md and skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
Draft an SRS from templates/srs-template.md.
Include use cases, screen descriptions, and linked requirements.
Reference Pencil artifacts under designs/[initiative-slug]/ and identify the target frame for each screen.
```

### Agile Story Breakdown

```text
Use AGENTS.md and skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
Break this feature into epics, features, and stories.
Use templates/user-story-template.md.
Keep acceptance criteria testable and align any UI stories to the SRS screens.
```

## Important Constraint

The `skills/` directory is written in Claude-style skill format. Codex should treat those files as instruction content to read and apply, not as an automatic native skill system.

That means prompts should explicitly tell Codex which playbook to consult when the task is non-trivial.

## Pencil For Codex

Use Pencil only for wireframes in SRS-backed work:
- store `.pen` files under `designs/`
- allow one `.pen` file to contain multiple frames
- reference both the artifact path and the target frame directly from the SRS
- keep screen IDs aligned across the SRS and Pencil frame names

## HTML Deliverable

The generated HTML is the editable stakeholder deliverable. Open it in a browser to update text, replace images, and add or remove blocks without editing the source HTML manually.

## Good Outcomes

You are set up correctly when Codex can:
- follow `AGENTS.md` without extra repo explanation
- read the BA playbook from `skills/ba-start/SKILL.md`
- draft a structured artifact from `templates/`
- reference Pencil wireframes from `designs/` at both artifact and frame level
