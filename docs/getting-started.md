# BA-kit Getting Started

## Purpose

This guide shows how to install BA-kit and use it in Claude Code and Codex.

For BA non-tech usage, start from natural-language requests and `PROJECT-HOME.md`. Commands remain available for precise reruns, but they should not be the first thing a BA has to learn.

## 1. Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anhdam2/bakit.git
cd bakit
```

## 2. Choose Your Runtime

BA-kit supports two usage modes:
- **Claude Code**: install BA-kit assets into `~/.claude`
- **Codex**: open the repo and use the root `AGENTS.md`

## 3. Install For Claude Code

Run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

What this installs:
- skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
- agents to `~/.claude/agents/`
- rules to `~/.claude/rules/ba-kit/`
- templates to `~/.claude/templates/`
- shared BA workflows and references to `~/.claude/ba-kit/`
- the shared update command to `~/.local/bin/ba-kit`

Then restart Claude Code if it is already open.

To update later, run one command:

```bash
ba-kit doctor
ba-kit install-plantuml
ba-kit update
ba-kit status --slug warehouse-rfp
```

This checks the registered BA-kit source repo, blocks when the repo has local changes or unfinished merge/rebase state, runs `git pull --ff-only`, then reruns the installers for any previously installed runtimes.
`ba-kit status` reads the registered source repo, prints the current artifact set, and flags likely stalled delegated slices from stale tracker heartbeats.
`ba-kit doctor` checks runtime readiness: install manifests, registered repo health, required local tools, and optional MCP hints for Notion.
`ba-kit install-plantuml` attempts to install PlantUML locally through a supported package manager so HTML packaging can render swimlanes without sending diagrams to a remote service.
Both commands also surface update availability when the registered upstream has newer commits.

## 4. Use BA-kit In Claude Code

Preferred natural-language entry:

```text
/ba-do <description>
```

Use `/ba-start` when you already know the lifecycle step or want the full BA pipeline.

Full workflow:

```text
/ba-start
```

BA-friendly workflow:

```text
/ba-do Tôi có tài liệu yêu cầu mới, hãy tạo dự án BA
/ba-do Tiếp tục dự án warehouse-rfp, bước tiếp theo là gì?
/ba-do Đánh giá thay đổi: Export CSV phải có audit log
/ba-do Chuẩn bị handoff UI cho module auth-flow
/ba-do Tôi nhận module auth-flow
/ba-do Gửi module auth-flow cho Lead BA review
/ba-do Xuất gói bàn giao cho stakeholder
```

Step-level reruns:

```text
/ba-start intake docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf
/ba-start impact --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start backbone --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start frd --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start stories --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start srs --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start wireframes --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start package --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-start status --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-notion srs --slug warehouse-rfp --page https://www.notion.so/... --mode overwrite
```

Router and deterministic helpers:

```text
/ba-do dang lam do SRS thi them yeu cau nay
/ba-impact --slug warehouse-rfp Khong co nhom admin user
/ba-next --slug warehouse-rfp
/ba-collab Tôi nhận module auth-flow
```

Default `/ba-start` handles the full BA lifecycle once routing is already clear:
1. Parse raw input into an intake form
2. Gap analysis and clarifying questions
3. Scope lock and mode selection
4. Requirements backbone production
5. Gated FRD and user story generation
6. Selective SRS production
7. Design decision capture and project runtime `DESIGN.md` creation when wireframe support is justified
8. Wireframe constraint-pack and manual handoff-map production from the use cases, Screen Contract Plus, locked IA snapshot, and approved `DESIGN.md`
9. Final screen description production as an enrich pass
10. HTML packaging for the emitted artifact set

### Claude Example

```text
/ba-start
Here is our requirements doc: docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf
```

When prompted, provide the file path or paste your requirements text. The skill will:
1. Parse and normalize the input into a structured intake form
2. Identify gaps (missing stakeholders, unclear scope, no success criteria)
3. Ask 3-8 clarifying questions
4. Generate `PROJECT-HOME.md` so the BA can resume from a plain-language dashboard
5. Generate a scoped work plan
6. Produce a requirements backbone, then emit FRD, user stories, use cases, Screen Contract Plus, project runtime `DESIGN.md`, wireframe handoff artifacts, final screen descriptions, and FRD/SRS HTML output only when their gates are open

For rerun commands:
- pass `--slug <slug>` when more than one project exists
- if one slug has multiple dated artifact sets, BA-kit should stop and ask which set to use
- use `/ba-start status --slug <slug>` to inspect completion before rerunning a downstream step
- use `/ba-start impact --slug <slug>` when a requirement, rule, scope item, actor responsibility, or screen behavior changes while a downstream artifact is already being drafted
- treat `impact` as the default change-triage path when the user says things like "đang làm dở SRS thì thêm yêu cầu này" unless the edit is obviously wording-only
- treat a short correction statement like "Không có nhóm admin user" as `impact` in an existing project context; do not interpret it as a direct edit request unless the user explicitly asks to update an artifact
- for `srs`, start from the exact resolved backbone and user-stories artifacts, and pull the FRD only when it exists or is required, instead of rereading the whole `plans/reports/final/` and `plans/reports/drafts/` directories
- for `frd` and `stories`, start from the exact resolved backbone artifact instead of rereading the whole `plans/reports/final/` directory
- if you only have old reports named like `002-intake-form.md`, treat them as a legacy suite and rerun or migrate them before expecting the current `/ba-start` contract to resume from them
- for non-trivial delegated work, expect BA-kit to create trackers under `plans/{date}-{slug}/delegation/`
- treat a delegation tracker with no heartbeat for more than 10 minutes as likely stalled and inspect or rerun that slice instead of waiting blindly
- once you explicitly approve a mutating rerun step, BA-kit should continue that step instead of reverting to generic prompts about what to do with the document

## 5. Use BA-kit In Codex

Codex does not need `install.sh`.

Instead:
1. Open this repository in Codex
2. Make sure the root `AGENTS.md` is visible in the repo
3. For freeform BA requests, tell Codex to use `skills/ba-do/SKILL.md` first
4. Tell Codex to use `skills/ba-start/SKILL.md` when the lifecycle step is explicit
5. Point Codex to the correct template under `templates/`
6. If you have the Codex-converted bundle, run `bash scripts/install-codex-ba-kit.sh` once to copy the skills, agents, templates, and core contract into `~/.codex`, then register Codex agents in `~/.codex/config.toml`
7. If you use the installer, make sure `node` is available because the registration step runs on Node.js
8. The installer also records the source repo for the shared update command `ba-kit update`
9. The Codex installer also copies shared BA workflows and contract references into `~/.codex/ba-kit/`

### Codex Example

```text
Use AGENTS.md and skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
Parse the requirements in docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf.
Include use cases, Screen Contract Plus, a project runtime `DESIGN.md`, final screen descriptions, linked requirements, test cases, and wireframe constraints.
Make the wireframe output a manual handoff pack so the user can design externally and manually attach the result to the final document.
```

BA-friendly Codex resume prompt:

```text
Use AGENTS.md.
Read PROJECT-HOME.md for slug warehouse-rfp if it exists.
Tell me the next BA step in Vietnamese first, then run the safe BA-kit workflow for that step.
```

If the Codex conversion is installed, you can point Codex directly at the bundled skill:

```text
Use ~/.codex/skills/ba-start/SKILL.md and the registered BA agents under ~/.codex/agents.
Parse the requirements in docs/raw/warehouse-rfp.pdf.
Produce an intake form, a requirements backbone, gated FRD/stories/SRS artifacts, a project runtime `DESIGN.md`, manual wireframe handoff artifacts when justified, final screen descriptions, and browser-editable FRD/SRS HTML when those artifacts are emitted.
```

For partial reruns in Codex, be explicit about the target slug and dated set when ambiguity exists. Example:

```text
Use AGENTS.md and skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
Run only the wireframe rerun path for slug warehouse-rfp.
If multiple dated sets exist for that slug, stop and ask me which date to use.
Reuse the existing `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md` if it is approved, otherwise ask me to refresh it before preparing the wireframe handoff pack.
Use the persisted `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-input.md` when it exists, or rebuild it from exact fallback sources before preparing the handoff pack.
Then report `/ba-start status` semantics with artifact dates, wireframe handoff state, and any wireframe input/map artifacts.
```

Change-impact triage in Codex:

```text
Use AGENTS.md and skills/ba-start/SKILL.md.
I am writing the SRS for slug warehouse-rfp and this new requirement arrived:
"Export CSV must require permission, record an audit log, and show a success or failure banner."
Run the equivalent of `/ba-start impact --slug warehouse-rfp`.
Resolve the exact dated set instead of choosing by mtime.
Tell me the source of truth to update, the affected artifacts, and the exact commands to run next.
```

See [codex-setup.md](./codex-setup.md) for more prompt patterns.

Runtime defaults for both Claude Code and Codex:
- BA deliverables are written in Vietnamese by default unless the user explicitly requests English
- the dated artifact-set token is `YYMMDD-HHmm` across report filenames and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`
- Shadcn UI is the default wireframe constraint baseline unless explicitly overridden by the approved project `DESIGN.md`

`plans/` is a local runtime workspace. BA-kit writes generated plans and report artifacts there during an engagement, but those files are not meant to stay version-controlled in the toolkit repository.

## 5.1 Update BA-kit In One Command

Once you have installed BA-kit for Claude Code, Codex, or both, update it with:

```bash
ba-kit doctor
ba-kit update
```

Or from inside the agents:

```text
/ba-kit-update
/ba-notion frd --slug warehouse-rfp --parent https://www.notion.so/... --mode create
```

Expected behavior:
- read the registered source repo from the local install manifests
- fail fast if the repo has local edits, conflict state, or multiple conflicting source repos
- run `git pull --ff-only`
- rerun `install.sh` and/or `scripts/install-codex-ba-kit.sh` for the runtimes already installed from that repo

## 6. Add Manual Wireframe Handoff For SRS Work

BA-kit no longer generates wireframes directly with MCP in the default flow.

Before Step 9 prepares or reruns the wireframe handoff pack, capture or confirm the project-specific design decisions and persist them to:

```text
designs/[initiative-slug]/DESIGN.md
```

This `DESIGN.md` is a project-specific runtime artifact, not a BA-kit product artifact. It becomes the system design document for the manual wireframe handoff pack and summarizes the approved visual tone, colors, typography, component feel, layout principles, responsive behavior, and anti-patterns for that initiative.

The Step 9 outputs are:

```text
designs/[initiative-slug]/DESIGN.md
plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-input.md
plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-map.md
plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-state.md
```

Rules:
- keep screen IDs aligned between the SRS and the manual wireframe handoff pack
- use the approved `DESIGN.md` as the wireframe system document
- use Shadcn UI as the default component baseline only when `DESIGN.md` does not specify a different direction
- keep the SRS focused on behavior, validation, states, navigation, and traceability
- the user designs the actual wireframe manually or with an external AI/tool, then manually inserts the final reference into the SRS
- treat the packaged HTML suite as the editable stakeholder copy: update text, swap images, and add or remove blocks directly in the browser without editing the source HTML

## 7. Deliverables And Runtime Artifacts

A full `/ba-start` engagement produces final BA deliverables plus runtime artifacts used during downstream design handoff:

| Deliverable | Template | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Home / BA dashboard | `project-home-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/PROJECT-HOME.md` |
| Collab Home / BA collaboration dashboard | `collab-home-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/COLLAB-HOME.md` |
| Module Home | `module-home-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/MODULE-HOME.md` |
| Module review packet | `review-packet-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/delegation/review-packets/{module_slug}.md` |
| Intake form | `intake-form-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/01_intake/intake.md` |
| Requirements backbone | `requirements-backbone-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/02_backbone/backbone.md` |
| FRD | `frd-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/frd.md` |
| FRD HTML | `scripts/md-to-html.py` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/04_compiled/compiled-frd.html` with rendered Mermaid and safely handled PlantUML diagrams |
| SRS | `srs-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/srs.md` |
| User stories | `user-story-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/user-stories.md` |
| Project runtime DESIGN.md (bán thành phẩm) | `design-md-template.md` | `designs/{slug}/DESIGN.md` |
| Wireframe constraint pack | `wireframe-input-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-input.md` |
| Wireframe handoff map | `wireframe-map-template.md` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-map.md` |
| Wireframe state | BA-kit routing metadata | `plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/wireframe-state.md` |
| SRS HTML | `scripts/md-to-html.py` | `plans/{slug}-{date}/04_compiled/compiled-srs.html` as the primary browser-editable stakeholder copy |

If you need a clean read-only stakeholder handoff, generate HTML with:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py --no-editor plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/srs.md
```

If `plantuml` is not installed yet, install it locally first:

```bash
ba-kit install-plantuml
```

If you want the packaging script to attempt local installation automatically before rendering, use:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py \
  --no-editor \
  --auto-install-plantuml \
  plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/srs.md
```

Only when local rendering is unavailable should you fall back to a self-hosted or otherwise approved PlantUML service:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py \
  --no-editor \
  --plantuml-server https://plantuml.internal/plantuml/svg/ \
  plans/{slug}-{date}/03_modules/{module_slug}/srs.md
```

Packaged HTML keeps Mermaid diagrams visualized in-browser, always prefers local PlantUML rendering, can auto-install PlantUML locally when requested, and falls back to a configured server only when local rendering is unavailable. Wireframe images or links inserted into the markdown source are preserved only when those asset paths stay inside the allowed base directory.

## 8. Know Where To Look

- Runtime instructions for Codex: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- Claude-oriented project instructions: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
- Codex-specific setup notes: [codex-setup.md](./codex-setup.md)
- Skill catalog: [skill-catalog.md](./skill-catalog.md)
- Methodology guide: [ba-methodology-guide.md](./ba-methodology-guide.md)
- Design runtime artifact details: [designs/README.md](../designs/README.md)

## 9. Practical Tips

- Start with `/ba-start` and let the skill guide you through the lifecycle
- Use subcommands when a later step must be rerun without redoing intake and FRD work
- Always provide raw input (file or text) when starting an engagement
- For UI scope, provide the project `DESIGN.md` direction explicitly, or let the skill ask for decisions and prepare the manual wireframe handoff pack
- If you already have external mockups or links, plan to attach them manually into the final SRS after Step 9
- Use `--slug` for rerun commands whenever more than one project may exist
- Treat `/ba-start status` as the checkpoint view: it prints artifact dates plus wireframe handoff state (`completed`, `skipped`, `not-applicable`, `missing`) and any persisted wireframe input/map artifacts
- Ask for assumptions and open questions before asking for finalization
- Use PlantUML for swimlanes; use Mermaid for sequence, data-flow, ERD, or simpler process views
- Use `/ba-notion` when the deliverable needs to be published into Notion rather than only packaged as local HTML
