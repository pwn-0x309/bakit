# BA-kit Project Overview

## Summary

BA-kit is a reusable toolkit that equips Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity for professional business analysis work. It standardizes a solo-IT-BA-friendly lifecycle from raw input to packaged deliverables through unified skills, focused agent roles, reusable templates, workflow rules, a BA-facing Project Home dashboard, and module collaboration dashboards.

## Problem Statement

Agent coding environments are usually optimized for software implementation. Business analysis work needs different defaults:
- structured elicitation and intake normalization
- a single persisted source of truth before formal and Agile requirement artifacts are emitted
- traceability from business goals to test cases
- reusable templates for recurring deliverables
- wireframe constraint packs for UI-backed scope

BA-kit closes that gap with a BA-first operating model.

## Objectives

- Make BA workflows repeatable across projects
- Reduce duplicated writing for solo analysts
- Reduce time spent rebuilding templates and checklists
- Improve consistency of requirement quality and acceptance criteria
- Support Agile, Traditional, and Hybrid delivery styles
- Keep deliverables easy to hand off to product, engineering, and operations teams

## Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/ba-start/` | Single unified BA skill covering intake, backbone-first analysis, gated artifact emission, and packaging |
| `agents/` | 4 specialized delegation roles for parallel execution |
| `rules/` | Workflow and quality standards |
| `templates/` | BA deliverable structures including the requirements backbone |
| `plans/{slug}-{date}/PROJECT-HOME.md` | BA-facing dashboard generated per engagement for resume, next-step guidance, and runtime prompts |
| `plans/{slug}-{date}/COLLAB-HOME.md` | BA-facing collaboration dashboard for module ownership, review, blockers, and GitHub handoff state |
| `designs/` | Project runtime `DESIGN.md` files that constrain manual wireframing and external design handoff |
| `AGENTS.md` | Persistent Codex repository instructions |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code project instructions |

## Product Scope

### In Scope

- Intake normalization and gap analysis
- Requirements backbone and gated requirements engineering (FRD, SRS)
- User story generation
- Critical-screen-first wireframe constraint preparation for UI-backed scope
- Quality review and packaging
- Template-driven documentation

### Out of Scope

- Full project management automation
- Domain-specific regulatory logic beyond starter guidance
- Code generation for implementation teams
- Diagram rendering beyond Mermaid plus PlantUML swimlanes

## Target Users

- Business analysts
- Product managers doing BA work
- Consulting teams running discovery engagements
- Solution analysts supporting implementation squads

## Success Metrics

- Users can start with `/ba-start` and receive a complete BA workflow
- Non-technical BAs can resume from `PROJECT-HOME.md` without understanding command syntax first
- Non-technical BAs can claim modules and request review without learning commit/branch/PR first
- Every requirement has acceptance criteria
- Installation takes less than five minutes
- Codex can use the repo immediately through `AGENTS.md`

## Design Decisions

1. BA-kit uses a single unified skill instead of many disconnected skills.
2. The requirements backbone is the default authoring source after intake.
3. Four focused agent roles handle delegation without overlap.
4. Templates are first-class assets because BA deliverables are repeatable.
5. PlantUML is the standard for swimlanes; Mermaid remains the portable default for the other diagram types in markdown.
6. Hybrid methodology is the default for solo IT BA work.
7. SRS and wireframes are gated by real handoff, UI, and risk needs instead of always being emitted in full.
8. `PROJECT-HOME.md` is a dashboard, not a source of truth; source-of-truth precedence remains backbone then intake.
9. GitHub is an optional transport layer; BA-facing collaboration state lives in Collab Home, Module Home, and review packets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Project structure exists and installs cleanly
- Skill, agents, rules, and templates are internally consistent
- Cross-references between files are valid
- Core BA outputs can be generated from templates without rework
