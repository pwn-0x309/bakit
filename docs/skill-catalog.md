# BA-kit Skill Catalog

## Purpose

This catalog explains when to use each BA-kit skill, what it produces, and which templates or agents typically support it.

## Recommended Chains

### Discovery to Formal Requirements

`ba-discovery` -> `ba-stakeholder` -> `ba-requirements` -> `ba-acceptance-criteria`

### Agile Product Framing

`ba-discovery` -> `ba-user-stories` -> `ba-acceptance-criteria` -> `ba-communication`

### Process Improvement Initiative

`ba-process-mapping` -> `ba-gap-analysis` -> `ba-feasibility` -> `ba-change-management`

### Regulated Change

`ba-requirements` -> `ba-compliance` -> `ba-acceptance-criteria` -> `ba-documentation-manager`

## Invocation Examples

```text
/ba-discovery
/ba-requirements
/ba-process-mapping
/ba-compliance
```

## Expected Quality Bar

- outputs reference business goals
- stakeholders are named and classified
- acceptance criteria exist for requirement-level statements
- diagrams use Mermaid
- risks, assumptions, and open questions are visible
